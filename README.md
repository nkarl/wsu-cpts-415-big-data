This is the repo for CPTS 415 Big Data.  This is an *asynchronous* course.

## Course Topics

### Introduction

- *Big Data:* concept, research problems, hot research trends and emerging applications.
- *Big Data Models:* basics on relational data models and semi-structured data
- *Graph Data:* graph data models, basics on graph theory
- *From Data to Knowledge:* a knowledge discovery process
- ***Course Project:*** Choose your real-life datasets and justify a data model to present it.

### From Data Models to Databases

- *Relational Databases*
- *Beyond Relational Databases:* noSQL systems, Key-Value store, Column store, Big Tables
- *Graph Databases:* architecture, storage, indexing and graph views
- ***Course Project:*** Choose and get familiar with an open source database system (provide list) and a query language.

### Extracting Information from Big Data

- *Relational Data Querying:* query languages and algorithms
- *Querying Big Data and Graphs:* XML, SPARQL
- *Feasible Big Data Querying:* Approximate queyring models
- *Making Big Data Small:* querying optimization, compression, sampling techniques
- *Drinking from A Firehose:* querying dynamic graphs and data streams incremental query evalulation, answering query using views.
- ***Course Project:*** Based on your earlier implementation, test a "Big Data" search idea.

### Scalable Big Data Processing: Platforms and Systems

- *Distributed and Parallel Computing Models*
- *Parallel Queyring, Distributed Processing Models and Systems:* MapReduce, Apache Mahout and Giraph project, Apache Spark, vertex-centric models, GraphX, Pregel, GraphLab.
- ***Course Project:*** Implement a parallel/distributed version of your earlier algorithm using MapReduce, Spark and cloud services, e.g. Amazon AWS.

### From Big Data to Big Knowledge

- *Data Mining over Massive Datasets*
- Storytelling: Big Data Visualization.
- Big Data, Big Ethics: privacy and security.
- ***Course Project:*** finish your project with a knowledge of discovery process.
